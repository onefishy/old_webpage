# About
I'm the Data Science Graduate Program Advisor at the [Institute of Applied Computational Sciences](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu) at Harvard University. I'm also a machine learning researcher in the [Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab](https://dtak.github.io). I am interested in building models with guaranteed properties that align with task-specific desiderata, such as interpretability, risk-awareness, satisfaction of domain-specific constraints. 

In a former life, I did research in pure math (specifically algebraic topology) and was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Saint Mary's College of California.

## Outreach & Community Building
Since 2018, I've been organizing the data science workshop for the annual Women in Data Science Cambridge (WiDS) conference: [WiDS Datathon Workshop 2022](https://onefishy.github.io/wids_datathon/). Since 2021, I've served as the co-director of the [Worldwide WiDS Datathon](https://www.widsconference.org).

I am the organizer of IACS's [Data Science Pedagogy Winter Workshop](https://onefishy.github.io/data-science-workshop/) for educators of underrepresented college students in data science. I am also the faculty advisor of the [IACS Graduate Advisory Committee](https://iacs-gac.github.io/pages/about.html) and the facilitator of the [IACS Diversity, Inclusion, Leadership Reading Group](https://onefishy.github.io/DIL_in_tech/reading_group.html).

I'm the faculty mentor of the IACS PhD Working Group, a working group for IACS students who are interested in receiving support and mentorship through their PhD application process. [Sign up for the 2022 PhD Working Group](https://forms.gle/cyVFBi5qoNw96DNW6). Recently, I have also begun serving as a mentor in the Career Development program at [DataPoint Armenia](https://datapoint.am/k-minds/).

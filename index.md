# About
I'm a Research Associate at the [Institute of Applied Computational Sciences](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu) at Harvard University, working on machine learning research in the [Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab](https://dtak.github.io). Currently, I am interested in uncertainty estimation for deep models; more broadly, I am interested in building models with guaranteed properties that align with task-specific desiderata, such as interpretability, risk-awareness, satisfaction of domain-specific constraints. 

In a former life, I did research in pure math (specifically algebraic topology) and was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Saint Mary's College of California.

## Outreach
Since 2018, I've been organizing the data science workshop for the annual Women in Data Science Cambridge (WiDS) conference: [WiDS Datathon Workshop 2021](https://onefishy.github.io/wids_datathon/). Starting 2021, I am the co-chair of the [Worldwide WiDS Datathon](https://www.widsconference.org).

I am the organizer of IACS's [Data Science Pedagogy Winter Workshop](https://onefishy.github.io/data-science-workshop/) for educators of underrepresented college students in data science.
